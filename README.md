# newGradAPI

BIG SHOUTOUT to Pitt Computer Science Club for compiling a list of applications and regularly
checking if new ones are open, y'all saved us a lot of effort this recruitment cycle

Polls https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/NewGrad-2021 to determine if a new commit has been made
    - Wanted to utilize Webhooks but didn't own the repository so will set it to poll hourly

If updated, sends text with company and url of new application using the Twilio API
